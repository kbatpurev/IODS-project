*Github repository : https://github.com/kbatpurev/IODS-project.git This course seems like a good fit for me. Even though i am familiar with most of the topics listed, i always find gaps in my knowledge and technique as i am self-taught R student. The bit that i am looking forward to the Git and Rmarkdown part a lot. I am a complete novice on both, but i am planning to get into it with sleeves up.I learnt about the course through Sisu. RHDS is a pretty good option for a crash course i feel. I liked the exercises. Favourite chapter was 4, data visualisation.*

#Lets see what Australia looks like
gapminderAustralia=gapminder %>% filter(country=="Australia")
#Only just over 3 folds! Less than Mongolia=Very interesting.

  geom_point()

t.test(lifeExp~gdpPercap>20000,data=gapminder1997)
#Life expectancy in countries with gpd above 20000 (i am guessing USD) is higher than poorer countries. Expected
